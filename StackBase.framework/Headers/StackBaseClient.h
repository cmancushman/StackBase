/*!
 * @brief Creates a new table in your MySQL database with specified name, columns, and primary key
 * @discussion In MySQL, a table contains rows and columns. Columns define what a row must contain, and each column may have specific properties. For instance, the column 'id' might only accept INTS, while 'firstname' might only take VARCHARs (Strings). Every row is an instance of all  the columns. For example, a table with columns 'id', 'firstname', 'lastname', and 'email' may have many rows, and a row may look like: '3', 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@gmail.com'. This method is used to create one such table in the MySQL Database. If a table already exists with the name you are trying to use, the method will execute, but you will receive an error message, and the completion block will give you the table that already existed in the MySQL database, not the one you attempted to create. If you want to create a new table with the same name, first remove the table from the MySQL database using the method 'removeTableWithName:', and then create your table.
 * @param name the name of the table you wish to create
 * @param columns the columns you have specified for this table
